# Stochastic Calculus and Derivative Pricing - From First Principles

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive derivation of key concepts and models in quantitative finance, rooted in stochastic calculus. These notes reflect my PhD-level expertise in probability theory and focus on applying theoretical models to practical challenges in financial derivative pricing.

## Topics Covered
- **Stochastic Calculus Basics:** Martingales, Ito Integrals, and Quadratic Variations.
- **Pricing Models:**
  - Black-Scholes for options pricing.
  - Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models for interest rates.
  - Advanced stochastic differential equations applied to asset pricing.
  - Volatility Smile and Implied Volatility: Mathematical treatment and implications for option pricing.
  - Statistical Arbitrage: Leveraging quantitative models for profit in mispriced securities.
  - Multi-Asset Market Models: Correlated stochastic processes and their role in pricing baskets and exotic derivatives.
- **Numerical Methods:** Insight into simulations and practical computation.

## Why This Matters
The content here bridges the gap between rigorous mathematical derivations and their implications for real-world financial systems. These derivations form the foundation for robust predictive models, risk analysis, and portfolio optimization in quant finance.

## Getting Started
1. **PDF Notes**: Access the complete notes in the `notes` folder.
2. **Code (Optional)**: Sample Python notebooks that implement key models will be added soon.
